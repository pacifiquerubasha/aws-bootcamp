# AWS Bootcamp Day 2 Summary

## Architecture

A good requirement is to be measurable and specific, which will aid in understanding in the long run.

- Verifiable
- Monitorable
- Traceable
- Feasible

It's important to keep risks, assumptions, and constraints in mind.

### Risks examples:

- User commitment, late deliveries.
- Single point of failure.
- Assumptions are things that we pretend are true but are not.
- Budget changes,
- Stakeholders availability.
- Sufficient network bandwidth.

The technical limitations are:

- Time: 14 weeks of boot camp.
- Budget â€“ utilizing the free tier.
- AWS vendor selection.

In the design phase, we should sketch a diagram of the infrastructure. There are three steps to this:

1. **Conceptual design:** An abstract idea created by stakeholders without specific details.
   - Database, Server, no specifics.

2. **Logic Design:** How should it be implemented, without actual names.

3. **Physical design:** Represent the actual infrastructure that was built. IP addresses, EC2 instances, access resource names, bucket names. This phase is super important. "Dumb questions," such as "do we have enough skillsets, enough workforce?" must be asked.

Document everything:

- Where the data lies and how it works
- Use AWS's well-architected framework to review your workloads against current AWS best practices. The main idea is to ask the right questions without getting too caught up in infrastructure.
- Knowing the AWS well-architected framework allows you to ask stakeholders and engineers the right questions.
- It's good to ask what the goal of this meeting is, especially if they have different backgrounds. Try to overcome your fear of asking "dumb questions" and ask about architecture.

## Insights

In AWS right now, it's possible to select a black theme and default region (no more switching) [link](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/unified-settings-aws-management-console/)

## Security

It's good security practice to grant least access as possible, use AWS Organizations. Force to use MFA to spin up EC2 instances. Yubikey is also supported by AWS for 2FA.

Least privileges as possible
